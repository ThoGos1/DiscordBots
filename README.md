# DiscordBots
These are all different Discord Bots, using the same baseline.

There is a "Grammar Cop" bot, that looks for grammatical mistakes in every message sent in Discord, and if one or more are detected it will send a message with the correction.

There is a "Calculus" bot, that uses the Sympy module to calculate derivatives and integrals. Furthermore it is able to calculate area between two curves, volumes of revolutions, limits, and much more. Simply type the "+help" command in chat and you will get a guide for every feature included with the bot.
